              <p>We at Outland Dynamics are very familiar with developing/designing websites, in fact, the website you're currently on was created by one of our web designers. We will build the website from scratch, and even host it at your request. We can't do this on our own, however, we love to listen to how you want your website to look so we can bring you exactly what you had in mind. For a better look at what we fully have to offer please visit our <em>Portfolio</em> page.</p>

              <p>As you can imagine, developing mobile apps isn't easy. That's probably why you're looking into hiring someone. Here's a few reasons you should choose us: We can promise uncompromising quality, meaning that if you don't like the way your project is turning out, we will happily work with you to change it. We can develop your apps for any platform you throw at us. If you want an app that is the same on IOS, Android, and Windows phones then you've come to the right place.</p>

              <p>The reason that we started Outland Dynamics originally was to develop video games. With that being said, it's something we are very passionate about. We will make sure that your game runs efficently while maintaining the desired graphics we use in the game. We will make sure to provide you with the best possible game of your own design, and just like with the other categories, if you don't like where your project is going, we will work with you to change it to better suit your vision.</p>

        <h2 class="content-title">Price Structure for Development</h2>
        <p>There is no set price to develop anything listed above. We are not able to do this because there are many different variables involved. Such as: If you want us to host your website or how fast you need a project done, If we're making a game, do you need us to buy assets or can you provide your own? Like I said, there are a lot of different factors involved. Because of this, we will want you to contact us and specify what you would like done. Specify things like: The time frame and what exactly you want done. Anything further can be discussed through our email or you can try to contact us on our Outland Dynamics Discord server.</p>
