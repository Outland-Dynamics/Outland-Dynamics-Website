              <p>We at Outland Dynamics are no strangers to designing websites, matter of fact, the website you're currently looking at was designed by one of our senior web designers. We wil not only design these websites, we will also build the website, and host it. For a better look at what we fully have to offer go to the "Our Work" page.</p>

              <h3 class="card-titlema">Mobile Applications</h3>
              <p>As you can imagine, developing mobile apps is hard. That's probably why you're looking into hiring someone. Here's why you should choose us: We can promise uncompromising quality, meaning that if you don't like the way your project is turning out, we will happily work with you to change it. We can develop your apps for any platform you throw at us. If you want an app that is the same on IOS, Android, and Windows phones then you've come to the right place.</p>

              <p>The reason that we started Outland Dynamics was to originally make games. With that being said, it's something we are the most passionate about. We will make sure that your game runs efficently while maintaining those beautiful graphics we put in your game. We will make sure to provide you with the best possible game of your own design, and just like with the other categories, if you don't like where your project is going, we will work with you to change it to better suit your vision.</p>

        <h2 class="content-title">Price structure for development.</h2>
        <p>There is not a set price to develop anything listed above. We aren't able to do this because there are a ton of different variables involved. Such as: If we're developing a website, do you also want us to host it? If we are making an app, do you need it within the next few days? If we're making a game, do you need us to buy assets or can you provide your own? Like I said, there are a lot of different factors involved. Because of that, we will want you to contact us and specify what you would like done. Specify things like: The time frame you want it done by and what you want done. Anything further can be discussed through email or our Outland Dynamics Discord server.</p>
